2024 wasn’t perfect, but it was definitely life-changing. If I could put it simply, it was a reflective year—a year where I spent most of my time thinking about the events of the past. It was also the year I finally freed myself from the mental blocks that had been hindering me for the past two years of college. Being in the top 1% during high school had left me weak-minded when I started college—a person who almost refused to put in the hard work for something truly worth pursuing. *I learned it the hard way,* _**but at the very least I learn**_.

The outcomes were predictable: a series of failures during my first two years of college. _So many, in fact, that I stopped trying._ It became so complicated that I experienced a lot:

- fear of failure
- fear of being disliked
- fear of missing out
- fear of making mistakes
- fear of meeting new people
- fear of being my authentic self

—you name it. These were a depressing years, years with no purpose. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that fear is something that must be confronted, not avoided. That is, realistically, the only way to growth: pushing past our comfort zone. _**Feel the fear but do it anyway.**_

To put it blatantly, it took me nearly two decades to finally break free from all those shackles. It can’t be possible if not from people I met along the way. I’m so grateful for my mentors, peers, and experiences that shapes me the way I am now. Now that I’ve taken control, I’m also deeply sorry to everyone for the inconveniences caused by my past self. May we all find our way! 😊🙏🏻

2025, I have no intention of stopping. Maybe college is a one-year transformation after all.  
Cheers for more, cheers to youth. Brace, 2025.
