**Scrum**, in essence, is a framework designed to deliver value through adaptive solutions, especially in software development. It’s well-known for being **adaptive, iterative, and flexible**, making it a popular choice in the agile project management domain.

Scrum is grounded in empiricism and lean thinking. It operates on the belief that knowledge comes from experience and that decisions should be made based on what is known. It’s supported by three pillars and five core values. Let’s dive into them one by one!

### **The Three Scrum Pillars**

Embarking on a journey through the realm of software development with Scrum is like setting sail in dynamic seas. The guiding stars? The three pivotal pillars of Scrum: **transparency, inspection, and adaptation**. These principles not only steer projects toward success but also infuse agility and efficiency into the process.

- **Transparency: The Clear Waters of Communication**

Imagine transparency as the clear waters through which every member of the project can see. It lays the foundation for trust and collaboration by ensuring that all project-related information is openly shared among stakeholders. From the Sprint Backlog, which outlines tasks within a sprint, to the Product Backlog, a prioritized list of project needs, transparency ensures everyone is on the same page.

- **Inspection: The Compass for Continuous Improvement**

Inspection acts as the compass that guides the Scrum team, allowing them to assess their progress and the project’s trajectory. Through regular and frequent checks at key points — like Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-ups, and Sprint Reviews — teams can pinpoint deviations and celebrate achievements. This ongoing examinations are crucial for steering the project in the right direction.

- **Adaptation: Adjusting the Sails**

Following closely on the heels of inspection is adaptation, the principle that encourages teams to adjust their strategies based on insights gained. Whether tweaking the Sprint Backlog in response to new challenges or refining processes after a Sprint Retrospective, adaptation ensures the project remains aligned with its goals.

### The Five Core Values

![Image taken from [RebelScrum.site](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/4d79a1_2fdf655eda6340c68782740c09e75128~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_640,h_522,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/4d79a1_2fdf655eda6340c68782740c09e75128~mv2.png)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*_KMdE0eJ7RUTBYJgPtoqQQ.png)

The five core values of Scrum are **commitment, focus, openness, respect, and courage**. [The Scrum guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) eloquently puts it, “Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living these five values.” So, why are these values so crucial, especially when navigating the complex projects Scrum is designed for? Let’s take a closer, more casual look at each of these pillars that make Scrum teams truly exceptional.

### Commitment: All for One, One for All

Let’s imagine an elite Special Forces team, where every member is all-in, committed not just to the mission but to each other. This level of dedication is what we aim for in Scrum teams. It’s about each team member pulling their weight, trusting one another, and pushing towards a common goal with unwavering dedication. Leaders and Scrum masters can cultivate this sense of commitment by ensuring clear sprint planning and safeguarding the team from shifting goals mid-sprint.

### Focus: Keeping Our Eyes on the Prize

Scrum thrives on the sprint mentality — a set time frame to achieve specific goals. It demands that everyone keeps their eyes on the prize, focusing on their tasks and understanding how these contribute to the bigger picture. To maintain this laser focus, Scrum masters might limit task overload during sprints and foster a culture of full engagement in daily stand-ups, helping everyone stay on track.

### Openness: The Power of Transparency

Imagine a team where no challenge is hidden, and every member is an open book about their progress and hurdles. This openness allows Scrum teams to move swiftly, identifying and addressing roadblocks as they come. Encouraging such transparency, especially in daily scrums, fosters a culture where issues are addressed head-on, and collaboration is the norm, not the exception.

### Respect: Valuing Every Voice

In the symphony of a Scrum team, every instrument matters. Respect is about acknowledging each member’s contributions and capabilities, ensuring that everyone feels valued and heard. Scrum masters play a pivotal role here by modeling respect in every interaction — be it with stakeholders, the product owner, or team members — setting the tone for a respectful and inclusive team environment.

### Courage: Boldly Tackling Challenges

Finally, the courage to face tough questions, experiment with new solutions, and speak up when something’s amiss is what sets a Scrum team apart. It’s about not shying away from challenges but embracing them as opportunities for growth. Leaders can instill this bravery by leading by example — taking a stand when necessary and always being open to innovative approaches or difficult conversations.

Incorporating these five Scrum values into the fabric of your team isn’t just about following a methodology. It’s about building a culture that is **resilient, adaptive,** and **genuinely collaborative**. As we journey through our projects, let’s remember these values are not just principles to adhere to but practices to live by, ensuring our teams are not only successful but also truly exceptional.

### Why Use Scrum?

![Image taken from Medium by [Ant Murphy](https://medium.com/serious-scrum/25-agile-memes-to-get-you-through-a-difficult-transformation-21525954ed76)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*jCLbC9Z_ScBVlN1S8nuRUw.jpeg)

Great question! It’s a question worth diving into, especially in a world where managing projects efficiently and delivering value rapidly are more important than ever. Scrum, at its core, is not just a methodology but a transformative framework that adapts to the ever-evolving landscape of project management, particularly in software development.

Adapted from [SimpliLearn](https://www.simplilearn.com/scrum-project-management-article), the main advantages of utilizing Scrum include:

- Scrum can help teams complete project deliverables quickly and efficiently.

- Scrum ensures effective use of time and money.

- Large projects are divided into easily manageable sprints.

- Developments are coded and tested during the sprint review.

- It works well for fast-moving development projects.

- The team gains clear visibility through scrum meetings.

- Scrum, being agile, adapts to feedback from customers and stakeholders.

- Short sprints enable easier implementation of changes based on feedback.

- The individual effort of each team member is visible during daily scrum meetings.

As you can see, Scrum offers a robust framework for teams to navigate the complexities of project development with agility, collaboration, and a relentless focus on delivering value. Whether you’re tackling a small project or embarking on a large-scale development effort, Scrum provides the principles, practices, and tools needed to achieve your goals efficiently and effectively, making it a compelling choice for teams aiming for excellence in today’s dynamic project environment.

## Implementing Scrum with Tools: The Case of Linear

![Image taken from [Scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-scrum-module)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*XVZOLbf9rDKkmHUMTkW41A.png)

Embarking on the Scrum journey opens up a world of agility and efficiency, especially when armed with the right tools. Linear stands out as a beacon for those looking to implement Scrum methodologies seamlessly. Let’s take a stroll through the Scrum workflow, illuminated by [Scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-scrum-module) guidelines, and see how Linear can be our compass.

### Kickstarting the Journey: The Inception Phase

In the world of Scrum, every adventure begins with a clear map. This map is our **Project Requirement Document (PRD)**, detailing the features we seek, the challenges we might face, and the milestones along our path (sprint goals). Crafting this document is similar to charting the unexplored, ensuring our team knows what lies ahead. To implement PRD, you can try to fill a template provided by [AHA](https://www.aha.io/roadmapping/guide/requirements-management/what-is-a-good-product-requirements-document-template.) based on your own product.

![PRD Examples using AHA Templates](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5060/1*OHjvDio4d8y9_FvdN6X4uQ.png)

Now that our map (PRD) is setted up, it’s time to define the scrolls of quests which will be our **Product Backlog Items or PBIs. A PBI is a fundamental component in the Scrum framework, representing a single piece of work within a project’s Product Backlog. Think of the Product Backlog as a dynamic to-do list for a Scrum project, comprising various tasks, features, bug fixes, and enhancements that are necessary to achieve the project’s goals. Each of these entries on the list is a PBI. Each of a PBIs must have an acceptance criteria. **Acceptance criteria** outline the requirements a PBI must meet to be considered complete, and story points represent the complexity of the feature. Additionally, we’ll need to define the **Definition of Done**, which sets the standard that each PBI must meet to ensure an improvement in the product we are developing.

![PBI Example using Bahasa Indonesia](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6832/1*_EhA0LupxH4zeGSbyC10OQ.png)

As we prepared our map and the scrolls of quests, Linear will become our scribe, organizing these tales in a manner that beckons clarity and focus. Tools like Linear come into play by providing an organized way to manage these documents and tasks, from creating workspaces and projects to managing sprint cycles and backlogs. To setup sprint cycles in Linear, you can directly navigate into Cycles on the left pane menu. Typically, a sprint cycle spans 2 to 4 weeks. Each PBI, with its own story, acceptance criteria, and complexity (story points), is not just a task but a step towards something greater.

To create a new PBI, navigate to your project in Linear. Simply click on Backlog _(on the left pane menu)_ then find and click the `+` button located at the top-right corner, just below the Display option. Then, you can click Create Issue button. Remember to fill out the title, description, and any other relevant fields as well.

### Setting Sail: Sprint Planning with Linear

With our map drawn, our next rendezvous is the **sprint planning**. Here, our crew of developers, led by the Product Owner and the Scrum Master, decides which part of the map we’ll explore next. Linear’s workspace becomes our planning room, where epics and PBIs are not just planned but brought to life. The outcome of the sprint planning session is the sprint backlog, which includes **the sprint goal**, **the PBIs selected for current sprint**, and **the adjustment plans for completing each PBI**. Let’s dive more into it!

**Setting a Sprint Goal**

![Sprint Goal Setup on Linear](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6840/1*bK7Au5mICAS3guZQusZFeg.png)

Setting a sprint goal is like choosing our north star, guiding us through the sprint. Linear helps us plot this star in our digital sky, making sure it’s visible to every member of the crew. To set up a new sprint goal, you can click on Cycles. Then, right-click on the cycle you want to set the goal and select edit cycle. You can add the sprint goal in the description section.

**Defining (PBIs) selected for current sprint cycle**

Then, after we’ve finished setting up our sprint goal. We can divide our quest into manageable tasks, Linear’s boards and lists will become our logbook, tracking our journey’s progress. With a well-defined goals and backlog in place, the team can hit the ground running at the start of the sprint, with a clear set of priorities and a plan for how to approach them. This clarity and focus are essential for maintaining momentum, fostering team collaboration, and achieving the sprint’s objectives.

To define the PBIs in the current cycle, click on the Backlog menu. Then, right-click on the PBI you want to include in this sprint (_make sure you have one)_. Choose cycle and select the appropriate cycle.

![Current Cycle Backlog Defining on Linear](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6840/1*8P7oy0CClj5yprEgB-zUKw.png)

The active backlog can now be viewed in the Active submenu under Issues.

![Example of Active PBIs](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6840/1*P_gv8tdsAElSREF7Sf-hKg.png)

You can also adjust the story point of each PBIs and developers that will work on the assigned PBI.

**Adjustment plans: Breaking down PBI into smaller issues**

When dealing with complex features or large PBIs, breaking them down into sub-issues can significantly clarify the scope and requirements. It allows for detailed planning and estimation, enabling the team to address different aspects of the feature systematically. While it’s not mandatory. this method helps in aiding developers in visualizing the work needed and facilitates easier adjustments and prioritization within the sprint, ensuring a smoother workflow and more focused effort on each task.

To do this, first off, click on the Active submenu and select the appropriate PBI. Then, click the Add sub-issues button and enter the details for the smaller tasks. To wrap it up, click Save button to save your configuration. You can add more sub-issues to tailor the work to your specific PBI.

### The Daily Sail: Navigating with Daily Scrums

![Image Taken from [Medium by SimeonOnSecurity](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1024/1*l2r3NvU1kFbY3qhTQ5YbCA.jpeg)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*zBiFBK914fwvAqSEcpJ8hw.jpeg)

As we sail through the sprint, our **daily scrums** are the compass checks ensuring we’re on course. Each day, our crew gathers to share discoveries, adjust sails, and sometimes, weather storms together. This brief, typically 15-minute meeting, can happen either **online** or **face-to-face**. The focus of the daily scrum is **to review progress towards the sprint goal, make necessary adjustments to the sprint backlog, and plan the day’s work**. The primary aim of hosting a daily scrum is to enhance communication within the scrum team, identify any obstacles, make decisions, and reduce the need for other meetings.

**Leveraging the Scrum Board on Linear for Enhanced Transparency**

In Scrum, transparency is not just a value but a necessity. It ensures that every team member is on the same page regarding the progress of the ongoing sprint. To embody this principle, along with the values of inspection and adaptation, Linear offers a powerful tool: **the Scrum board**. This board allows teams to track and monitor the progress of Product Backlog Items (PBIs) throughout the sprint. There are two main ways to use this feature on Linear, which can be interchangeable by navigating into `Issues > Display` _(On the top-right corner)_ . Let’s dive into them!

- **List Mode:** By switching to the list view on the Issues page, you can easily update the status of specific PBIs based on their current progress within the sprint. This method is straightforward and keeps everything organized in a list format, making it easy to review and update items as needed.

![List Mode Example](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6840/1*YHb390E9ji5XYuuadyUtvA.png)

- **Board Mode:** For a more visual approach, you can use the board mode, which allows you to drag and drop PBIs into different status columns. This method is particularly useful for visual learners and those who appreciate a clear, graphic representation of progress.

![Board Mode Example](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6840/1*UyTB5CL20BhT7cN85Hw64Q.png)

The Scrum board in Linear not only facilitates transparency but also enables continuous inspection and adaptation of the work process. By keeping the status of PBIs up-to-date, teams can swiftly identify any bottlenecks or issues, discuss them in daily scrums or as needed, and make informed decisions on adapting their approach. This real-time visibility into each PBI’s progress is crucial for maintaining the momentum of the sprint and ensuring that the team is moving together towards their sprint goal.

### Our Discoveries: Sprint Review

At the end of each sprint, we land on our temporary shore — **the sprint review**. Here, we **showcase our findings to the stakeholders**, possibly through a live demo in a staging environment, allowing stakeholders to see what has been accomplished during the sprint and the value derived from the work done. We can also use Linear to illustrate our journey’s progress. Any PBIs that have been accepted by the stakeholders will have their status changed from ‘In Review’ to ‘Done’. Meanwhile, PBIs that are not completed can be carried over to the next cycle for continuation. To put it simply, sprint review is a moment of celebration, reflection, and sometimes, learning from the missteps.

![Change PBI Status on Linear](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*mKaOZKoh7QQorPo3rKsOhg.png)

### Finding Key Adjustments: Sprint Retrospective

Finally, we’ve arrived at our final checkpoints for the current sprint. The **sprint retrospective** is our moment to gather around the campfire, sharing tales of the sprint past. The Sprint Retrospective is all about **brainstorming ways to boost the team’s quality of work and efficiency**. It’s a time for the Scrum Team looking at everything from how the team members worked together, the processes they followed, the tools they used, to whether they met their Definition of Done. Each project’s unique, so what they focus on can differ based on what they’re working on.

They’ll pinpoint any assumptions that might’ve led them down the wrong path, digging into why that happened. The team gets real about what aspects of the sprint rocked, which parts threw them for a loop, and how they tackled various challenges — highlighting both the wins and the misses.

Using Linear at this stage can significantly streamline this evaluative process. By accessing the Cycles menu on the main page, teams can review a summary of story points covered, those completed, and the sprint’s success rate.

![Example on Cycles review at Linear](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6840/1*w2D_GdLrBhzvZ9KEWw_mDQ.png)

### The Continuous Quest: Iterating Towards Perfection

With Scrum and Linear, our journey is **continuous**, a loop of planning, navigating, discovering, and improving. If one sprint is over, we started another sprint until it’s completely over. Each sprint is an opportunity to adjust our course, ensuring that with each iteration, our product becomes a true reflection of our quest for **value, quality, and agility**. As we embrace these methodologies and tools, we’re not just managing projects, but we’re embarking on epic quests, building not just software, but legacies.

## My Closing Statements

As we wrap up this exploration of Scrum and Linear, it’s clear that the journey through software development is much like navigating the vast and often unpredictable sea. Scrum, with its principles of transparency, inspection, and adaptation, serves as our compass, guiding us through the complexities and challenges of project management. Linear, on the other hand, acts as our sturdy vessel, equipped with the tools and features we need to plot our course, track our progress, and adjust our sails as necessary.

Let’s round off with a interesting quote from Jeff Sutherland, one of the brains behind Scrum. He once said:

> “At its root, Scrum is based on a simple idea: whenever you start a project, why not regularly check in, see if what you’re doing is heading in the right direction, and if it’s actually what people want? And question whether there are any ways to improve how you’re doing what you’re doing, any ways of doing it better and faster, and what might be keeping you from doing that.”
> ― **Jeff Sutherland, [Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/27337257)**

This quote really gets to the heart of Scrum. It’s all about keeping tabs on our progress, making sure we’re actually delivering what’s needed, and always looking for ways to up our game. By bringing Scrum principles into our work and using Linear to keep things organized, we’re not just ticking boxes; we’re constantly pushing for better, faster, more impactful results.

**Keep learning and growing!** ✨✨
