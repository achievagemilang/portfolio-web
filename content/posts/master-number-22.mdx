When we were younger, life just happened. *__We were simply shaped by the environment we were raised in.__*<br />
The kind that turns the once-prideful “smart” kid into someone who thought he knew everything and ended up a lone wolf.

Every fear, addiction, fraud, awkwardness, loneliness, and depression was a byproduct of it.<br />
Yet somehow, they started to feel meaningful:
<Callout emoji="💡" type="info">
    They made me realize that **every small decision and variable compounds**, for better or worse.<br/>
    They made me realize that **nothing great can be built alone.**<br/>
    They made me realize my sole purpose is to be meaningful to others, **to serve however I can.**<br/>
</Callout>
_After all, that’s what it means to be human._

It’s a miracle I’ve lived long enough to understand that.<br/>
It all makes sense now: **Life is the greatest gift God can give**, _but it’s an experience reserved for those willing to think deeply about it._ <br/>
For that, *__I am truly grateful.__* It wasn't always up, but I have my moments.<br/>

Kudos to everyone on the journey. 2025 felt amazing because of you all:
- **Families:** For all your love and good intentions. You know who you are.
- **Friends:** Know that you’re my inspirations. Even to those I barely talk to.
- **Mentors:** For believing in me. I’ve always loved your signature first-principle thinking and positive-sum games. Thank you for keeping that "fire" in me.


_Happy birthday. Happy belated graduation. Happy new year!_<br/>
Tutorials are over. **Welcome to the real game. :)**

_Enough yap. Until next time. 👋🏻_
