You sit down to work. You have a deadline. You even tell yourself, __Today, Iâ€™m going to focus.__ 

Then, five minutes later, youâ€™re watching YouTube videos about furry-like creatures *(namely cats + dogs)* or doom scrolling social media.

*__What just happened?__*

Iâ€™ve definitely been guilty of this issue for quite some time. Throughout my high school years, I was used to procrastinating and doing my work in short bursts rather than with consistent effort. This reminds me of James Clear's book, *Atomic Habits*. He talks about "compound interest" for self-improvement and how every action is a vote toward the person we want to become. If I keep waiting for the perfect moment and donâ€™t have the courage to start with what I have, I'll never change and will continue this procrastination habit for God knows how long.

It brought back insights I gained from a TED Talk by [Tim Urban](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator). He introduces the concept of the "Instant Gratification Monkey," where our brain is often controlled by a primitive being that is impulsive and values short-term gains. This is why we default to easy dopamine hits, like gaming or watching movies. The Monkey hates work because it doesnâ€™t get the same kind of immediate stimulation, which often results in individuals being labeled as "lazy."

But hereâ€™s a powerful idea: **Thereâ€™s no such thing as a "lazy" individual; itâ€™s a clarity problem.** Though I'm still searching as well, I like to think that once we figure out what we really want to achieve, the rest becomes easier.
